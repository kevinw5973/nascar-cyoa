# Rival dead  
Your rival begins to spin out of control. He slams into  the second place racer and his vehicle takes flight and flips over. His car hits the ground and explodes! The crowd goes wild and the vehicles that were falling behind begin to catch up. 5th place gets to the wreckage and slams into it causing a massive domino effect where every car behind you gets involved.
