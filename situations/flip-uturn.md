You quickly pass him and make the finish line where you are then be greeted by the police. The crowd boos at you and chants things like ‘Killer!’. The police then force you out of the race car and arrest you for the causing the accident that led to the death of 15 other racers. You are eventually charged, convicted, and given a death penalty for your brutal crimes. You took this rival thing a bit too far..
